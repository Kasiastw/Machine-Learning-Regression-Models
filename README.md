## This repository contains only projects using regression analysis techniques. Examples include:
 - a comprehensive analysis of real estate strategy using Lasso and Ridge regressions based on Ames Housing data. The goal was to estimate the sales prices of the houses and potential cost of renovations to maximize the return of the investment
 - web scraping of the job postings and predicting the salaries from Indeed
